Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Laughter is the best medicine.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Birds of a feather flock together.
The best things in life are free.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Haste makes waste.
Honesty is the best policy.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
