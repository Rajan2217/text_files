Look before you leap.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Good things come to those who wait.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
There's no place like home.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Better late than never.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
